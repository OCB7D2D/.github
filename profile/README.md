# OCB 7 days to die mod repositories

This org contains all the mods I've released for 7 days to die.
Pretty much all mods here are harmony mods, which means you
will need to disable EAC in order to use them. As a ground
rule you can assume if the mod contains a dll, it is not EAC
friendly. These are all compiled via my [Compiler Utils][1].
Note, that beside the name, not all mods use BepInEx, most
mods simply use the compiler helpers to compile the code!

You can also download most mods from [nexusmods][2].
